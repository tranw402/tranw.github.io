All developers have been there before.  Tasked with reading and comprehending another developer's code for whatever reason be it to continue development in the codebase, helping another developer write out their own code, etc.  It is not quite the most enjoyable task and I believe most developers will agree when I say that it is a hassle to do so.  However, the concept of a coding style can take out much of the time required to perform this usually mundane task.  Coding style establishes a set of syntax procedures to make a codebase generally uniform and can help developers comprehend the codebase quickly and get to developing programs faster.

## Developers Want To Be Writing, Not Reading Code

It is in the name of the job description.  Developers want to spend more time developing and less time reading.  However, the fact is that a lot of time as a developer must be spent reading through other developer's code and understanding how it works.  This is where coding style procedures can help.  Imagine if one was working on a codebase with potentially thousands of other developers, each with their own slightly distinct style of coding.  To get a grasp on the codebase, one would need to comprehend potentially thousands of distinct variations of coding which would not always be cleanly separated.  Simply put, a nightmare and a waste of time.  On the other hand coding style can establish a uniform format where one now only needs to learn one style of coding and can practically read through most of a given codebase from there.  There is not even a competition for which methodology would take less time.  So keep fellow developers in mind.  If you would not want to waste time comprehending thousands of coding styles, make sure other developers do not have to as well.

## Respecting Established Procedures

Because an established coding style can save so much time, many projects standardize one across the codebase.  Features of a coding style have been carefully thought out by past developers and there is a general consensus among maintainers of any given project to strictly adhere to these guidelines.  Therefore, it would be in the best interest of any new developer to a project to learn and adhere to the guidelines.  Do not make coding style decisions just because it might be more beneficial than the current guidelines.  These procedures have been in place (likely for a long time) for a reason.  All developers are busy people and no one wants to take time out of their lives to contact a new developer about making coding style corrections.  Though getting accustomed to a coding style might delay actually getting started writing code, this initial time effort demonstrates respect for the time of other developers working on a project as well as towards the guidelines that have been tried and true towards development.  It does not need to be difficult either with a plethora of tools out there that will correct coding style errors automatically.
