## A Preconceived Bias Against Javascript

As a low-level systems enthusiast who enjoys working with languages such as C and assembly, Javascript has always been the “web development language”.  It is not an area that has personally particularly piqued interest and therefore I have never really considered exploring Javascript.  In addition, I have heard many stories about the slow performance of executed Javascript code but I have not had the chance to test for myself.  On first impressions, it seems to have many similarities to other languages which made it relatively simple to pick up.  Most notably, it feels like you are able to code in the Java syntax and the code just runs correctly.  It was definitely very interesting to see the other forms of syntax in ES6 which demonstrated how flexible of a language Javascript seems to be.

## Never Hurts To Learn

Although I am not making a switch to web development anytime soon, the flexibility of Javascript is one aspect where it begins to make sense why it is such a popular programming language.  There is no denying that Javascript is one of if not the most popular programming language in the world.  It is consistently ranked as the fastest growing and best languages to pick up as a developer by many lists.  Web applications are going nowhere anytime soon and there is demand for web developers who can design these applications to provide the best possible user experience.  There is no going wrong in gaining some level of proficiency in Javascript.

## 314’s Notorious Acronym

WOD or Workout of the Day.  This is an acronym that is pretty much synonymous whenever asking someone who is taking or has taken ICS 314.  Just the thought of completely failing one and getting zero points on an assignment always shakes people up to a certain extent.  Therefore, practice is key and the practice WODs are probably one of the best things you can do to prepare for these timed assignments.  I am personally not quite sure what to think of this learning style yet.  I am sure the pressure it presents works towards some level of reinforcement of the coding exercises but that is something that would need to be reassessed in the future.
